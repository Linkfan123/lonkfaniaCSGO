# lonkfaniaCSGO
This repo contains all/most of the CS:GO maps I have made.
## Maps included
* de_linksecondo  (a bloated, unfinished defuse map set in a root beer factory)
* aim_linksecondo (an earlier, bombsite-less linksecondo map)
* de_lonkfaculty  (a small and fast-paced defuse map set in a random office building)
* de_bridge       (a _very_ small and _very_ WIP defuse map based on a random concept I had)
* de_mercer       (a large, open WIP defuse map based on the country)
* de_levels       (a quite small WIP defuse map with a bombsite on two floors at once)

## Files included
* BSP   (the compiled map that you can play right now)
* VMF   (the uncompiled map that the BSP is based off of; the work file)
* NAV   (tells the bots how to navigate the level)
* KV    (tells what the default gamemode is, what playermodels to use, and other stuff)
* TXT   (modifies the loading screen text)
* ZTMP  (compressed versions of BSP and NAV files for servers)
* VMX   (a backup version of the VMT)

Every map _should_ include a BSP, VMF, and NAV. Not all maps include a KV, TXT, ZTMP, or VMX file.
